Nick's auto-erase feature is a simple function call in the init function of mytimers.js:
document.getElementById('destroy').click()
Currently it is disabled.

AFTER CREATING THE STUFF TO READ, IT IS SHOWN. BEING SHOWN, A BEELINE IS READY TO GO - 
 - ADD THE BUTTONS FOR STARTING AND STOPPING A TIMER
	1 - SHOW THE READING, COLORIZED, WITH THE OBVIOUS START AND STOP BUTTONS FLOATED LEFT AT THE TOP AND RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE READING - PRESSING STOP WILL STOP THE TIMER AND INITIATE LIGHTBOX. NEXT THE TIMER
	BUTTONS WILL RECORD FOR THE NON BEELINE READ, WITH THE FINAL STOP BEING THE FORM'S SUBMIT

NEXT - update read count on read when beeline created
 - add jquery to create buttons to make timer
 - display trickery for showing reads one at a time or side by side
 - lightbox ui for process

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

create this in parallel to the blog style
 - create a route that after saving a new post, the next page is creating a new comment on it
(after creating a new read, begin a beeline on it)

"How to redirect_to a new comment on this post?"

this is not needed, when updating a read, the action will also add a new beeline
" If there are no task fields on the form (because we removed them all with JavaScript), then existing_task_attributes[] won’t be assigned by the form, which means our Project#existing_task_attributes= method won’t be invoked. By assigning an empty hash here if existing_task_ attributes[] is empty, we ensure the Project#existing_task_attributes= method is called to delete the last task."


 - the case where there are no tasks (there is no beeline to include), could be where a reading has been submitted, but the reader does not want to attempt a timed read yet. 
button
	save reading, try beeline later 
instead of
	start a BeeLine reading comparison
