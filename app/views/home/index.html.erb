			BeeLine Reader is an exciting new technology that helps people read faster on computers, smartphones, and tablets.  BeeLine Reader applies a color gradient to text that helps reduce “line transition errors” (accidentally skipping a line or re-reading the same line twice).  The color gradient generated by BeeLine Reader helps guide the reader’s eyes from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, which significantly reduces the chance of accidentally skipping or repeating lines.</p>
		<p class="whatisit">
			How does it help?</p>
		<p class="answers">
			By making line transitions easier and more natural, BeeLine Reader allows the reader to transition more quickly from line to line.  This increases reading speed, particularly on mobile devices that have small screens and short lines.</p>
		<p class="answers">
			A study designed and carried out by a Stanford graduate student of Communications showed an average reading speed increase of over 10 percent for first time users of BeeLine Reader.  Speed increases of 25 to 30 percent are not uncommon.</p>

			Think of how much time you spend reading (email, news, textbooks, work) each day.  If you read just two hours each day, BeeLine Reader could save you hours every week!</p>
		<p class="whatisit">
			How can I get BeeLine Reader?</p>
		<p class="answers">
			BeeLine Reader is easy to set up, and even easier to use.</p>
		<p class="answers">
			There are two steps: the first step is carried out by Readability, which is a third-party browser plugin.  Just go to the Readability site and follow the simple installation instructions.</p>
		<p class="answers">
			The second step is carried out by the BeeLine Reader bookmarklet (“bookmark” plus “applet,” which is a chunk of java code).  There are several versions, each of which uses a different color scheme.  To install the bookmarklet, all you have to do is drag the link into your bookmark bar!</p>
		<p class="answers">
			To use BeeLine Reader, just click on the Readability plugin, wait for it to load the text, and then click on the BeeLine Reader bookmarklet.</p>
		<p class="answers">
			Our bookmarklet solution is compatible with Macs, PCs, iPads, iPhones and many other devices.  We hope to have our own, standalone, FireFox plugin coming soon!</p>
